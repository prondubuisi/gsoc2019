# Tasks

Run Psalm on more CiviCRM repositories with different strictness levels and tweaks, repositories from [Issue](https://lab.civicrm.org/community/gsoc/issues/3) and mentors
Understand the underlying workings of [Psalm](https://github.com/vimeo/psalm) @prondubuisi


It would be interesting to see how the error count varies as you adjust the strictness.
How about forking the API project, you can then push up the psalm config and link to it from this repo via the readme maybe. We could use this repo as a project summary/entry-point to the other projects that you run psalm against.
